              <p>- Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</p>
              <p>- Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces daily.</p>
              <p>- CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings and when around people outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.</p>

           <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
           <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.</p> 
           <h3>How is COVID-19 spread?</h3>
           <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</p>
