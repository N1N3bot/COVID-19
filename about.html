          <p>We are students who are attending California State University Northridge. We are currently attending COMP484 and have been tasked with creating a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript; this is our project to showcase the tools we have learnt through out the semester. We decided to create a COVID-19 site to help inform people in a quick and easily accessible site, seeing as how the amout of people getting infected is still rising.
